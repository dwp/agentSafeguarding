<p class="govuk-body">In future, you will not be able to use your password or security question. You must use your Personal Security Number (PSN) instead. This is a sixteen-digit number that would have been issued to you by a DWP employee in your first jobcentre appointment. If you do not have a PSN then you can make an appointment with your jobcentre to be issued with one.</p>
