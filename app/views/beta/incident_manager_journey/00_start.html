<ul class="govuk-list  govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>This email is triggered by the confirmation page of the incident report journey</li>
    <li>This prototype links straight to the first question of the journey: in reality, the journey will start with Searchlight sign in and a dashboard screen (TBC)</li>
    <li>There are three versions of content for this email. Which one the incident manager sees will depend on what the incident reporter selected on <a class="govuk-link" href="../report_incident/reportv8/acting_managerv1.html">the 'Identify appropriate manager' screen</a>:</li>
</ul>

<ol class="govuk-list  govuk-list--number">
    <li>If the incident reporter selected 'My line manager' on <a class="govuk-link" href="../report_incident/reportv8/acting_managerv1">that screen</a> to indicate that <b>the line manager and the incident manager are the same person</b>, <a class="govuk-link" href="00emailprompt">email 1</a> shows the content for the email that should go to the line / incident manager.</li><br>
    <li>If the incident reporter selected 'Another manager' on <a class="govuk-link" href="../report_incident/reportv8/acting_managerv1">that screen</a> to indicate that the line manager and the incident manager are different people, <a class="govuk-link" href="00emailprompt_2">email 2</a> shows the content for the email that should go to the <b>line manager</b>.</li><br>
    <li>If the incident reporter selected 'Another manager' on <a class="govuk-link" href="../report_incident/reportv8/acting_managerv1">that screen</a> to indicate that the line manager and the incident manager are different people, <a class="govuk-link" href="00emailprompt_3">email 3</a> shows the content for the email that should go to the <b>incident manager</b>.</li>

<ul class="govuk-list  govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>Email 1, 2 and 3 are designed here but not finalised</li>
    <li>Email 4, 5 and 6 are not designed here but will have similar content to 1, 2 and 3 to re-iterate advice</li>
